This solution maintains two variables: `min_price` and `max_profit`.

- Iterates through the prices list once.
- Updates `min_price` to keep track of the lowest price seen so far.
- Updates `max_profit` to track the maximum profit achievable by selling on the current day.
- This approach has a time complexity of O(n).
