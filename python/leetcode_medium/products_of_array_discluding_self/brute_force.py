def brute_force(nums):
    """
    Compute the product of all elements in an array except for the element at the current index using a brute force approach.
    
    This function iterates over each element of the input list `nums` and multiplies every other element to produce an output list 
    where each position contains the product of all other elements. The solution uses a nested loop to achieve this, resulting 
    in quadratic time complexity.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): A list of integers representing the array for which the product of all elements except the self element 
                      for each position needs to be computed.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of integers where each element is the product of all elements of the input list except the element 
               at the current index.

    Time Complexity:
    O(n^2) - Where 'n' is the number of elements in the input list, due to the nested loop iterating over the list for each element.

    Space Complexity:
    O(n) - Requires additional space for the output list which holds 'n' elements, where 'n' is the size of the input list.

    Example:
    >>> brute_force([1, 4, 6, 7, 2])
    [336, 84, 56, 48, 168]
    """
    nums2 = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if i != j:
                nums2[j] *= nums[i]
    return nums2
