def topKFrequent(nums, k):
    """
    Return the k most frequent elements in the list `nums`.

    This solution works by first counting the frequency of each element in `nums`,
    then sorting these elements based on their frequency in descending order, 
    and finally returning the top k elements.

    Steps:
    1. Count the frequency of each element in `nums`.
    2. Convert the frequency map to a list of tuples and sort it by frequency.
    3. Extract and return the top k elements from the sorted list.

    Time Complexity:
    - O(N log N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
      - Counting frequencies takes O(N).
      - Sorting the frequency list takes O(N log N) due to the sorting operation.
      - Extracting the top k elements takes O(k), which is dominated by the sorting step.

    Space Complexity:
    - O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
      - The frequency map (`frequency_map`) requires O(N) space.
      - The sorted list (`sorted_elements`) also requires O(N) space.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): A list of integers where some elements may repeat.
    k (int): The number of most frequent elements to return.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list containing the k most frequent elements from `nums`.

    # Step 2: Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples and sort by frequency
